                <h2>Vincent van Gogh: A Tormented Genius</h2>
                <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter known for his expressive and vibrant artworks. His distinctive style, marked by bold colors and textured brushstrokes, had a profound impact on modern art. Van Gogh's life was marked by personal struggles and mental health challenges, and he is famous for cutting off part of his own ear during a period of distress. Despite facing limited recognition during his lifetime, his posthumous legacy includes iconic works like "Starry Night" and "Sunflowers," making him one of the most celebrated and influential artists in history.
